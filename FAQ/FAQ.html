        <p class="faq-text">
          Wisdom teeth, officially referred to as third molars, are usually the
          last teeth to develop. They are upper and lower teeth whose function
          is to grind food as part of the digestive process. They are located in
          the very back of your mouth, next to your second (or twelve year)
          molars and near the entrance to your throat. They usually complete
          development between the ages of 15 and 20, a time traditionally
          associated with the onset of maturity and the attainment of Wisdom.

          What is The Best Age To Have Them Removed?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          If it is recognized that you do not have enough room in your mouth for
          your third molars to erupt, it is advisable to have them removed as
          soon as it is recognized. In some patients it is as early as 11 or 12
          whereas in others it may not be until 17 or 18 years of age. You will
          heal faster, with more predictable final healing and have fewer
          complications than an older patient.

          What Happens On The Day They’re Removed?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          First of all, you need to decide if you will be sedated (‘go to
          sleep’). Most people clearly prefer to be unaware of the experience
          when they have their Wisdom teeth removed. You will be provided with
          appropriate anesthesia options for you at your consultation. On the
          day of your procedure, you will take medications to help minimize
          post-operative pain and swelling. We ask that a parent or responsible
          adult accompanies you to the office, where they must remain during the
          entire procedure and they should plan on staying with you the rest of
          the day. Your procedure will take about an hour and you will probably
          be in the office for 1 ½ -2 hours. Our surgical assistants will review
          your post-operative instructions. When you leave the office you will
          be comfortable and drowsy. Most patients prefer to go home and rest
          with no other physical or scholastic activities planned for a few
          days. All outpatient surgery is performed under appropriate anesthesia
          to maximize your comfort. We have the training, license, and
          experience to provide various types of anesthesia to allow patients to
          select the most appropriate alternative. These services are provided
          in an environment of optimum safety, utilizing modern monitoring
          equipment and staff experienced in anesthesia techniques.

          What Happens Afterwards What Will I Feel Like?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Most of the time you will want to maintain a low profile for a few
          days. We ask that you follow your post-operative instructions closely
          as they will make you most comfortable during the first few days
          following your procedure. Please allow the time to let your body begin
          healing before resuming an active social, academic, or athletic
          schedule. Most patients feel like they are over the hump in 3-5 days.

          removal of their wisdom teeth, visit our

          What If I Still Have Questions Before Surgery?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          We recognize that having your Wisdom teeth out is NOT something you
          really want to do. We also realize that with an active schedule there
          is never a really good time to have this done. If this information,
          combined with information you receive at your consultation appointment
          doesn’t answer all of your questions, please call our offices to speak
          to one of our Patient Care Coordinators: 456-567-1987.
